# Tic-Tac-Toe🎮

**Tic Tac Toe** is an interesting game that my friends and I made when we were still freshmen. We built it together using C++, which was an exciting way to learn programming fundamentals and teamwork. This project made me love coding even more! 👾

### How To Play
1. Download the [TicTacToe-Team7-2.1.cpp](url)
2. Compile it, run it, and you're ready to play!
3. Enjoy the game!

### Here Is The Rules
1. It’s a 2-player showdown! ✖️ vs ⭕
2. Players take turns selecting a box (row and column) to fill with either ✖️ or ⭕.
3. First player that fill the straight line (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins 1 point! 🎉
4. After the game ends, you can either go for a rematch or call it a day. The choice is yours!
